    // C++ programs have a single entry point called the main function.
    // An entry point is a function that executes when a user runs a program.
    // Functions are blocks of code that can take inputs, execute some instructions,
    // and return results.
    // Exit codes are integer values that the operating system uses to determine
    // how well a program ran. Generally, a zero (0) exit code means the program
    // ran successfully. Other exit codes might indicate a problem.
